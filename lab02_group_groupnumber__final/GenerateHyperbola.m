function [ HData ] = GenerateHyperbola( n, a, b , x0, y0, theta )
% GenerateHyperbola : Generate n points on Hyperbola. 
%   a --> such that, a will be major axis of Hyperbola
%   b --> such that, b wiil be minor axis of Hyperbola
%   x0 --> X-coordinate of center of Hyperbola
%   y0 --> Y-coordinate of center of Hyperbola
%   theta --> Angle in degree, measured from X-axis to major axis

HData = zeros( n , 2 ); %Follow this dimensions
