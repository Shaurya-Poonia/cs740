%% Write your observations with c=0 and 0.15 for sink, multi-component, tree and wiki programs here

sink (c = 0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In here C = 0 will  give correct solution.
because we have removed dangling node problem by adding a vector of values 1/n in place of 0 vector
corresponding to sink node.
Now every column of C has
 column sum equal to 1.
rank vector will be vector corresponding to eigen value 1+0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sink (c = 0.15)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
In here C = 0.15 will also give correct solution.
because we have removed dangling node problem by adding a vector of values 1/n in place of 0 vector
corresponding to sink node.
Now every column of C has column sum equal to 1.15.
rank vector will be vector corresponding to eigen value 1+0.15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


multi-component (c = 0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In here C = 0 give multiple rank vectors.
There will be multiple eigen vectors corresponding to eigen value 1.
Each of eigen vector(rank vector) will correspond to a particular component.
Since there is no interaction among different components, we can't compare their rank by taking 
c = 0.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


multi-component (c = 0.15)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In here C = 0.15 will solve the problem faced with c = 0 and we will get one rank vector.
There will be single eigen vectors corresponding to eigen value 1.15.
By adding C/N*I(where I is a matrix of size NxN with each element 1 and N is number of nodes),
we have introduced new link between nodes which makes sure that there is dependence between 
components.
Since there is  interaction among different components, we can compare their rank by taking 
c = 0.15.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


tree (c = 0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In here C = 0 will  give correct solution.
because we have removed dangling node problem by adding a vector of values 1/n in place of 0 vector
corresponding to sink node.
Now every column of C has column sum equal to 1.
rank vector will be vector corresponding to eigen value 1+0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


tree (c = 0.15)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In here C = 0.15 will also give correct solution.
because we have removed dangling node problem by adding a vector of values 1/n in place of 0 vector
corresponding to sink node.
Now every column of C has column sum equal to 1.15.
rank vector will be vector corresponding to eigen value 1+0.15
