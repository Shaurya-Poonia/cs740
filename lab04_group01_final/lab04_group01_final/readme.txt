Honor Code :- The code we have written is completely implemented by us. We have taken help of references during implementation.

We havenâ€™t used any late days yet. For this assignment, we will be using 2 late days.

	1) We have used this reference for monte carlo method used in Question 1.

	2) We made an attempt to use PCA for 6th question. But there was a difficulty in reducing the covariance to lower dimensions. Finally we used the approach taught in class.

	3) For 5th question, we have taken help from sample simulation posted by the instructor.
